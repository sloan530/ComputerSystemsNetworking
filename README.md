### Fall 2021 ECPE 170 Computer Systems and Networking

---

## Lab 2: Version Control

using bitbucket for version control. practicing different commands for git

---

## Lab 3: C Programming (Language, Toolchain, and Makefiles)

hands-on experience with the C programming language, the development toolchain (pre-processor, compiler, assembler, linker), and automating the compilation process using Makefiles.

---

## Lab 4: C Programming Project

focuses on dynamic memory allocation, pointers, file I/O, and string manipulation.

write a program to play a game named Frigate, which is a one-sided game of Battleship in which the computer hides the ships, and the player must destroy them before s/he runs out of ammunition (the player has a limited number of shells per game).

---

## Lab 5: Performance Measurement

tools to measure program's performance and use of CPU and memory resources, as well as identify specific locations in the code where performance bottlenecks may exist.

---

## Lab 6: Performance Optimization

1. How can the compiler improve application performance?
2. How can the programmer do a better job than the compiler at improving application performance?  (And why is this?)

---

## Lab 7: Performance Optimization (Memory Hierarchy)

focus on how computer memory systems store data, and how the implementation of memory systems -- especially the cache(s) -- affects program performance. Also, measure the performance of computer memory system under different application behavior patterns.

---

## Lab 8: Network Socket Programming (Basic)

Python programming language to implement a simple HTTP client that can download files from a webserver.

---

## Lab 9: Network Socket Programming (Intermediate)

Python programming language to implement a simplified DNS client that can send requests for basic IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

DNS (the Domain Name System) is a hierarchical, distributed database that stores information associated with domain names, e.g. myhost.com. The most common piece of information is the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with that domain name. However, DNS can also store a wide variety of other domain-related information, such as the associated domain mail servers, name servers, domain name aliases, reverse DNS lookups (obtaining a DNS name from an IP address), anti-spam records such as Sender Policy Framework, and many other record types.

---

## Lab 10: MIPS Assembly Programming (Basic)

SPIM simulator and MIPS assembly programming by writing a sequence of programs with increasing complexity.

---

## Lab 11: MIPS Assembly Programming (Intermediate)

write a program in MIPS assembly that uses proper function calls and the stack.

---

## Lab 12: MIPS Assembly Programming (Advanced)

write a program (in both C and MIPS assembly) that allows a human to play against a computer in Connect Four , specially the 5-In-A-Row variant.

---

## midterm

video presentation on Singly Linked List in C and Deletion of 5th Node

---

## final

in-class coding exam
1. MIPS programming - converting C into Assembly code
2. Python programming - transmit two numbers to a server which will add them together and return the sum
